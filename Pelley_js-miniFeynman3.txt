Objects are collections (of properties) which are treated as things in JavaScript. They are distinguished by types.

Properties (written inside curly brackets) are the variables or values which are "stuck to" or attached to objects. 
Just as real-world objects have shapes, colors, etc., JavaScript objects have characteristics, which the properties define by descriptive names (also known as "keys")

Methods are the name we give to functions (which make the code do something) when they are serving as properties.

* for in loop
A for... in loop runs through all the properties of an object.
If John Doe is age 25, a for in loop would look like this:

var person = {fname: 'John', lname: 'Doe', age: 25);

var text = '';
var x;
for (x in person) {
    text += person[x];
}
As it runs through it would display John Doe 25 to the console.

* dot notation vs bracket notation
Dot notation (in this form, for example: myCar.color) is used only if a property is known, or when you want to name and create a property.

Bracket notation can both be used to call or create properties in an object, such as when you're applying a variable to some array's property, 
since functions often take strings (of text etc.) as arguments 
Bracket notation uses, and applies strings to, the object(s).
